# ChessProject2.0
Quasi-chess game - with slightly different movement rules, and figures limited to pawn and rook.
In other hand you get nice customization - why not to play on bigger board with rooks only? 

Give yourself a chance to make some mess on board - playable version avaliable at https://khamer1410.github.io/ChessProject2.0/
